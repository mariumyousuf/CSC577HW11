In this assigment we implemented the RANSAC algorithm to fit a line, solidified understanding of planar homography, and explored multi-view geometric constraints for keypoint matching. We also looked at the configuration of a fundamental matrix and image stitching using SIFT, homography, and RANSAC.

\subsection{Contributions}
Kayla contributed with SIFT extractions, arranging SIFT features, and SIFT visualizations. Marium implemented RANSAC algorithm, the Direct Linear Transform method to compute homography between two planar images, and used the homography with RANSAC to improve keypoint matching. Both discussed the derivation of fundamental matrix and image stitching and Marium was primarly responsible for implementing them. Both also consulted each other back and forth when either was stuck.
