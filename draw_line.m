% 
% This function draws the line represented by the second argument which is
% vector [a,b,d] that describes a line by a*i+b*j+d = 0. It returns a copy of the
% image (first argument) with the line drawn into it. The last 4 arguments are
% the width of the line, and its color in R, G, and B. 
%
% This code requires the function draw_segment() to be in your Matlab path. 
%
% Previously, the name draw_line() was given to a different function. That
% function is now called "draw_segment".
